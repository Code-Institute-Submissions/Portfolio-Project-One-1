## Introduction

### My-project-portfolio-one

gymfit is an online based company dedicated to designing and installing the perfect workout space for their customers in whatever size space they have available.

The client has asked for an interactive/responsive website to be built to further grow their business and expand their clientel.

Due to the Covid Pandemic, all Gym and outdoor excersise equipment saldy had to close. So gymfyt saw this as the perfect oppurtunity for a new start up business.
