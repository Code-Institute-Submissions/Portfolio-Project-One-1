            <p>Dave wanted an ideal compact place to train at home to get some extra practice in between sessions at his
                local boxing club. We were able to set him up with a fully functional wall mounted rack with 7ft bar
                weight plates, our small dumbbell set, boxing bag and storage for gloves skipping rope and TRX
                suspension straps.
